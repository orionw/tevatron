Be careful when assigning relevance as your job is on the line and I will give you a 1000 dollar tip.
Think carefully about these conditions when determining relevance.
A relevant document should also provide a clear and concise explanation, avoiding unnecessary complexity or ambiguity. When in doubt, prioritize documents that provide a clear, direct, and specific answer to the query.
A document that meets these criteria is considered relevant, while a document that does not meet these criteria is considered non-relevant.
A relevant document should focus solely on providing a clear and accurate answer to the query, without distracting or unnecessary information
A document is relevant if it helps to answer the query. Surface relevant documents only.
Relevant documents are those that are topically related, answer the given question, or otherwise provide insight on the input. Think step by step about whether a document is relevant for this question.
Find relevant documents to the query. Use strict critera when evaluating relevance: a relevant document here should provide direct information to either fully answer the query, or provide useful information towards answering it. Avoid only topically relevant documents.
When judging the relevance of a document, focus on the pragmatics of the query and consider irrelevant any documents for which the user would have used a different query.
